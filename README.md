# Logic Link
Logic Link is a mod for Zeepkist that adds some quality of life features for logic blocks!

## Features
Select logic trigger and head parts independently with multiple move modes!
- **Combined**: Selected and deselected parts move as one. This is the vanilla behaviour
- **Strict**: Deselected parts won't move. Selected parts can only move on a 2d plane because of that
- **Loose (Position)**: Selected parts can move in the whole 3d space. Deselected parts can move side to side
- **Loose (Rotation)**: Selected parts can move in the whole 3d space. Deselected parts rotate around their y axis. Their position remains unchanged

Toggle a plane to visualize where selected parts can move without changing deselected parts position or rotation! (This is the plane that strict mode uses)
